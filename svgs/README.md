# SVGs

The SVGs were obtained by:

1. exporting individual slides from the received pptx to pdf. This had to be done using google slides instead of libreoffice impress because the latter renders gradients incorrectly.

2. exporting the pdf to svg using inkscape

3. removing the unneeded parts using inkscape

4. grouping the individual images and naming them using inkscape

5. these are then batch exported to png using inkscape

6. they are then resized using imagemagick and put into frontend/img
